## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The typical users of this type of website are families and friends who want to get together on vacation and have fun. They might not want to deal with the hassle and expenses of other hotels and booking services. These websites make it possible for customers to have more options to explore when taking trips. Maybe change the hero image to something more realistically affordable to not drive away customers. Make it more specific to location to help users know what to choose.
